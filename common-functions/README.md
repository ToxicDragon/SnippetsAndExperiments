Common Functions
================

A potpourri of examples, little tools and playful experiments I come up with while exploring funtional programming techniques in general and ways to apply them to Java.
The code snippets might not be of any real world use. It's mainly intended to be self-educational and explorative.

------

The code makes heavy use of the [guava][1] library. The guava guys stronly recommend not to overstress a functional style when writing java code. So this project is a very abusive example of using guava.
